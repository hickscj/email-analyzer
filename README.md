# Email Language Analyzer

In the last round of elections, I became curious about the word frequency and usage in the overwhelming glut of political emails that I received. I've also been wanting to get into Natural Language Processing in Python, so this presented a great opportunity to experiment with the available libraries and even see what visualizations I could implement.

## Tools in this repo:
- Script for connecting to and downloading email from via IMAP
- Cleaning and filtering of the email text
- Storage of text in some capacity (currently just txt files)
- Creation of word frequency tuples with NLTK
